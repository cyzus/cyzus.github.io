Yizhou Chi 池一舟

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, where I work with [Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io/) on building language agents that collaborate safely and effectively with people. I study how we can give models the tools to interpret subtle intent, reason through multi-step tasks, and stay grounded in long-term conversations.

Before Cambridge, I completed my M.S. in EECS and B.A. in Computer Science & Cognitive Science at UC Berkeley under the guidance of [Dan Klein](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/). Those years sparked my fascination with language understanding, structured reasoning, and the human side of AI systems.

## Research focus

- Designing interactive language agents that can clarify uncertainty, self-correct, and remain aligned with user goals over time.
- Developing reasoning frameworks that help AI build faithful world models and explain their decisions.
- Studying how people and models co-adapt in conversational settings, with an emphasis on safety, transparency, and evaluation.

## Publications

- **SELA: Tree-Search Enhanced LLM Agents for Automated Machine Learning**  \
	*Authors:* <u>Yizhou Chi</u>, Yizhang Lin, Sirui Hong, Duyi Pan, Yaying Fei, Guanghao Mei, Bangbang Liu, Tianqi Pang, Jacky Kwok, Ceyao Zhang, Bang Liu, Chenglin Wu  \
	We frame AutoML pipeline design as a tree-search problem, enabling LLM agents guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search to plan experiments, reuse past insights, and converge on strong configurations.  \

- **THOUGHTSCULPT: Reasoning with Intermediate Revision and Search**  \
	*Authors:* <u>Yizhou Chi</u>, Kevin Yang, Dan Klein  \
	*Findings of NAACL 2024*  \
	We demonstrate how decomposing candidate solutions and revising them via MCTS yields state-of-the-art structured reasoning while keeping the search space inspectable.  \
	[[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05966) · [[code]](https://github.com/cyzus/thoughtsculpt)

- **CLARINET: Augmenting Language Models to Ask Clarification Questions for Retrieval**  \
	*Authors:* <u>Yizhou Chi</u>, Jessy Lin, Kevin Lin, Dan Klein  \
	By conditioning on retrieval distributions, CLARINET teaches LLMs to ask targeted clarification questions that reduce ambiguity and consistently outperform heuristic baselines.  \
	[[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15784)

- **Feature Selection of High Dimensional Data by Adaptive Potential Particle Swarm Optimization**  \
	*Authors:* Xingyue Huang, <u>Yizhou Chi</u>, Yu Zhou  \
	*IEEE CEC 2019*  \
	We adapt particle swarm optimization with ReliefF-driven filtering to handle small-sample, high-dimensional classification tasks more robustly than standard PSO variants.  \

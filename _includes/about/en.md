HiÔºÅ

I am Yizhou Chi. 

I am currently a 5th year EECS master student @ UC Berkeley, advised by [Dan Klein](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/), and I just graduated with a double-major in Computer Science and Cognitive Science in Spring 2023.

My research interest centers around facilitating meaningful communication between humans and computers through language interaction. This entails developing AI systems capable of comprehending both implicit and explicit meanings conveyed by humans, maintaining long-term coherence in conversations, and continuously improving through self-correction and self-examination.


## Publications

- **Dialogue-based clarification system for document retrieval** \
**Yizhou Chi**, Jessy Lin, Kevin Lin \
*(Currently in submission)*



- **Feature Selection of High Dimensional Data by Adaptive Potential Particle Swarm Optimization** \
Xingyue Huang, **Yizhou Chi**, Yu Zhou \
*2019 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)* \
We proposed an improved algorithm on Particle Swarm Optimization, capable of classifying high-dimensional data with small training samples; The proposed algorithm makes use of ReliefF to reduce irrelevant features and follows an adapted way to select cut-points based on the feature size of the dataset to achieve higher average accuracy compared to the existed PSO algorithms. \

## Others

- **Interactive Flock Simulator** \
A 3D flock simulator that mimics the flying behaviors of birds using C++; adopted Boid algorithm as the basis of movements and implemented a GUI that allows users to interact with the birds \

- **An Empirical Study on Two-child Policy in China Based on Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning** \
**Yizhou Chi**, Xingyue Huang, Yu Zhou \
Applied statistical methods to explore different factors that influence the expectancy of a second child in China. An imbalance classification model is trained using real-world data from both rural and city regions \
